Welcome to my digital brain dump 👋

This site is my open notebook — a living, breathing collection of thoughts, resources, and lessons across a mix of topics I care deeply about.

Rather than keeping everything scattered across bookmarks, docs, and post-its, I’m building this space to **centralize and share** what I’m learning and doing.

### 🛡️ Cybersecurity

I'm passionate about Purple Teaming, Threat Hunting, and Incident Response. Expect to find:

- Lab setups using Docker, Vagrant, and Splunk
- Attack simulations with Atomic Red Team
- Detection engineering notes and use cases
- Security scripts, toolkits, and cheat sheets

### 🚗 Automobiles

I’m also a gearhead at heart. I’ll share:

- DIY car maintenance logs
- Performance mods and upgrades
- Tips for buying, maintaining, and troubleshooting vehicles

### 💰 Finance

Money matters. I’ll be writing about:

- Budgeting and personal finance strategies
- Passive income ideas (especially tech-driven ones)
- Side hustle experiments and reflections

### 🖥️ Technology & Projects

From scripting to homelabbing, I’ll post:

- Automation walkthroughs (Ansible, Python, Bash)
- Raspberry Pi and server experiments
- GitHub project breakdowns
- Tech reviews and tool comparisons

### 🎯 And More…

This is a brain dump — so whatever I find interesting, useful, or worth remembering might show up here: notes from certifications, book summaries, study guides, or random curiosity rabbit holes.

Whether you’re here to learn something new, build something better, or just browse, I hope you find value in what I share.

Stay curious,
