Welcome to **[mell0wx.github.io](http://mell0wx.github.io)** — my personal corner of the internet and ongoing **brain dump**.

This site is built using the beautiful, dark-mode-friendly [Moonrise Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/TolgaTatli/Moonrise) and acts as a **living collection of notes, writeups, and resources** that reflect my interests and growth in tech and beyond.

## 🧠 About This Site

This is not a blog in the traditional sense. It's a curated mess of things I'm learning, building, or exploring — loosely organized but always expanding.

Topics currently include:

- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity / Purple Teaming** – threat emulation, detection engineering, and hands-on labs  
- 🐧 **Homelab & Automation** – Docker, Vagrant, Ansible, ELK/Splunk setups  
- 📖 **Guides & Cheatsheets** – for tools, commands, and frameworks I use regularly  
- 🔍 **Threat Intelligence** – research, TTPs, and MITRE ATT&CK mappings  
- ⚙️ **Dev & Scripting** – useful scripts in Bash, Python, and more  
- 📚 **Career Notes** – cert study notes, job role research, and self-improvement paths  

It's a mix of documentation, experimentation, and digital gardening.
